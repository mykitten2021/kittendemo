                                I just wanted to thank you for making my experience with owning my first kitten everything I thought it would be and more. I thank you for answering the million questions that I asked, also for your honesty on your kittens on which one would be suited best for my family. I could not ask for a better kitten.</p>

                                I take this opportunity to express my thoughts about what a great experience it has been to add a Persian cat into my life! I contacted mykitten.in from the website and from our first contact they were friendly, professional, and available to answer all of my questions. I have also experienced the warmth and responsiveness from the sales team.</p>

                        There is a thumb rule for owning a cat, “You can never own a cat - A Cat Owns You!”. And, Persian cats tend to treat you as you treat them.
