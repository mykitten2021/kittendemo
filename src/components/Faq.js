  <summary>What should I know before getting a cat?</summary>
  <div className="conent-faq">
    <p>
    If you are going to be a proud cat owner and are curious to know what is it to be one, there are plenty of things that you need to know already. Cats prove to be excellent pets; they can easily cuddle up in your lap and are not at all loud like dogs. They like to curl up that helps you relax at the end of a hard day. But owning a cat is not an easy task.
</p><p>
You need to know how long the cats live so that you commit that span of your life to them. Also, you must keep our cats spayed and prevent them from becoming a feral cat. Apart from the above two, there are a lot more pointers to be remembered like, having a fixed feeding time, providing a litter box, cat grooming, scratching post for the kitty etc.
</p><p>
As we all know, cats love to discover, and you should let them do exactly that. Our cat breeders adhere to best breeding practices. Your new kitty may face some problems initially, so you should give them time to adapt to the new surroundings. In the end, it all comes down to the relationship you build with your cat.

  <summary>What is it like to have a pet cat?</summary>
  <div className="conent-faq">
    <p>
    Although owning a cat is like surrounded by a furry ball of love, but all they need is the returned affection. If you treat them well and pamper them all the time, they will reciprocate with purrs and cuddles. They prove to be a great companion while watching a movie and ask for soft strokes all the time. There will be times when your cat will amaze you with their intelligence and cleverness, but you need to shake it all off and image them as aliens in the body of a furry mammal.
</p><p>
You might not be able to keep up with your cat’s good health, but they would make you notice less affection. There’s nothing in this world that would make your kitty happier than being fed all the time. They love to eat all day long and may consume more than their tummy sizes, so you need to keep a check on their appetite.
</p><p>
Apart from these pointers, cats spend most of their time looking out for fun. They always crave for your attention and want to you play endless games. The cats love exploring new corners and weird places inside the house. They tend to hide into open drawers and get struck in closets.

    It is a known fact that cats are carnivores and require a diet rich in animal protein. For an optimal health, a high quality cat food is the best option. To ensure your cat’s growth and health, you may even consider a veterinarian and discuss about what is the best kind of food.
    </p><p className="bold-text">
    What exactly do they need? 
</p><p>
Cats can never live on vegan diet. They thrive on a meat food and require nutrients rich diet to meet the daily needs. We have all cat breeds available for sale. While it is good to feed your kitten with dry or wet food commercially available, you can even feed a variety to your feline by adding fresh meat in cooked or raw form.
</p><p>
Majority cats are fond of eating fish, but it is not suggested to add fish in the daily feeding. As fish contains fatty acids in high amount, it tends to lead to vitamin E deficiency especially in cats and might cause painful conditions.

How much food do they need?

The senior ones

  <summary>What is the cost of owning a cat in India?  </summary>
  <div className="conent-faq">
    <p>
      
The cost depends on the breed you are planning to adopt. Local Indian races might cost less than the high ends ones like the Persian or Siamese. If you plan to buy a cat from a breeder, they would be costly and are likely to make you prefer the idea of adoption. Also, the expensive cats are challenging to maintain, especially for the first time owners who are planning to get kittens for sale.
</p><p>
Apart from the cost price of the cat, you need to take care of their food. Since cats are hungry all the time and need munching, you must enlist the cost of each bag of dry and wet food.
</p><p>
Also, maintaining proper hygiene of your cat is not as easy as it sounds. You need to visit the vet almost every month and get your pet vaccinated, which would again require a separate budget. In india there are very less cat breeders who do natural breeding and we only deal with those who do. And if your cat gets infected by fleas or ticks, then you need to spend a lot on their shampoo, deworming and medicated powders.
</p><p>
After calculating and estimating all the expenses, the cost of an Indie cat will be approximately 17000 rupees per year. But once you list down all the costs of a Persian/ pure breed cat, these costs are likely to go higher.

  <summary>Never Do These Things To Your Cat</summary>
  <div className="conent-faq">
    <p className="bold-text">
    1) Skip flea and heartworm treatment
</p><p >
Keeping your cat free from flea and heartworms are never been easier and these infections can be fetal. Heart-warm can cause respiratory problems.This is the only place where you can seek cats for sale or buy kittens online in India. So try not to miss any of these treatments.
</p><p className="bold-text">
2) Keeping cat’s outdoors unsupervised
</p><p>
If you think your cat knows where she lives then you are wrong. Your indoor cat’s reactions to the great outdoors might lead her to curiosity, confusion and fright. She might forget her way back home in the traffic and hide in the bush if any strange dog approaches. Keep your kitty safely harnessed, leashed and reassured by your presence when in outdoors for her peace of mind and yours.
</p><p className="bold-text">
3) Leaving windows open
</p><p>
Leaving windows open in high buildings may take your kitty to excitement when flies comes in and and fly by the window creating curiosity in cat’s mind leading to jump out the window following the fly. Contact us for kittens for sale.You wouldn’t know where your cat is for hours and how hurt did she get. Always keep your window sturdy and closed when you aren’t around or limit the window opening.
</p><p className="bold-text">
4) Put-off vet visits
</p><p>
If you don’t feel the need of going to vet because your cat eats healthy, sleeps well and have not changed her activity levels for a day then you may be wrong as cat’s like normal humans can also experience subtle health shifts from poor vision to kidney dysfunction. Felines are masters in concealing their emotions and compensating for their problems. An annual vet examination can pinpoint the start of any health problems and can treat those minor issues before them becoming major issues.
</p><p className="bold-text">
5) Holding your cat on your lap
</p><p>
While driving as most cats likes traveling and seeing outside world but a free cat may get frighten and terrified in the car all open up without a carrier. Also an unconfined cat is distracting to the driver and vulnerable to injury or escape with your cat on the loose, ping ponging on the car and your final destination becomes a disaster. India’s only marketplace to buy kittens.  Get a cat’s carrier and buckle it up in place for a safe and happy road trip with your cat.
</p><p className="bold-text">
6) Pushing your cat off the counter
</p><p>
An inquisitive cat poking her nose in the roasted chicken that is kept for cooling in the kitchen counter may be annoying but she must not be treated like a feline frisbee. Pushing or through-ing her in frustration can harm her both physically and in spirit. Always hand your cat with gentle care and your cat is more likely to respond to your wishes in a better way.
</p><p className="bold-text">
7) Forget to brush your cat’s teeth
</p><p>
Cat’s aren’t fond of anyone searching their pearly whites. Your cat’s reluctant to widely open for her treats and never cleaning her teeth may make them filled with plaque which later accumulates and forms tartar leading to pain and even lacerations in the gums. Brushing your cat’s teeth regularly or at least few times a week is the best way

  <summary>Choosing cat food tips</summary>
  <div className="conent-faq">
    <p>
    While selecting any food item we must be vigilant and should properly check its nutritional value, type and ingredients etc. Now, let’s talk about my favourite breed of cats that is Persian kittens. If you are the parent of a cute Persian kitten then you must be aware of some unique facts related to it such as  Persian kittens have specifically different needs as compared to the other breeds and it is quite difficult for them to eat due to their unique face formation. So, you should choose the food which they can easily pick up and eat like the Royal Canin Persian Kitten Food which is specially designed to meet your cat’s needs having almond-shaped seeds with high nutritional value. The formula of this food is enriched with Omega 3 fatty acids and fibres that stimulate intestinal transit and naturally limits hairball formulation. Your cat will love its taste as well.

  <summary>Cat training tips</summary>
  <div className="conent-faq">
    <p>
    The importance of you commanding your cats and being your cat mending the commands are the main reasons we are discussing today. Make your cats learn to respond to your vocal cue and run your way. The main part of the training is making a distinct noise before feeding their favorite treat, the noise can be a vocal call to your cat or a click. Your cat will eventually lean to associate that noise with something positive and always head to you when they hear the same sound. Encourage this behavior and pet them well outside the normal treats. The command must start with short distances in the beginning and end in long distances over time. </p><p>Read our detailed blog here- <a href="">How to train your cat</a>
